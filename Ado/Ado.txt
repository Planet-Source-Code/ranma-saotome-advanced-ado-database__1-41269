Load your categorys in a treeview, create new entries under your personla categorys.
Three (!) completely  different kinds of searching will help you finding any entrie you
 are looking for.
You can create new categorys, delete or modify them. Learn how to create a better
database for contacts, source code or whatever.
The Treeview is resizeable ! easy by draging it to the left or right!
The sample application is 90% done, fully functionally and kept without a personal note
for a simple demo. (means no stupid pics and icons you are  deleting  anyway )
You can easily change everything for your own needs. The database is
MS Access 97 Format. (You can upgrade to MS Access 2000 without changing any code. )
